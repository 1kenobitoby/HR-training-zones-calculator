# Heart rate training zones calculator
A web app that allows people who are into aerobic exercise to calculate their heart rate training zones for different intensities of effort based on the HR zone intensities suggested by running coach Jack Daniels.

# Project description
This is a Streamlit web app written in Python 3.8.10. It calculates a user\'s maximum heart rate based on their age input and published equations. The user can override the calculated value if they wish.<br>
Based on their MHR, the app calculates heart rate training intensities for different fitness goals. The HR zone calculations use the relationships first published in Jack Daniels\' books including Daniels\'s Running Formula which have now been widely shared by Jack and others in online articles.<br>
The project has been built in Streamlit V1.27 and distributed as a public app on the Streamlit Community Cloud.<br>
There are no plans to develop or update the app (except for bug fixes). Users have the option to contact the authors to suggest changes or improvements which we might implement if we think they are a good idea and it\'s worth our while. But probably not.<br>

# How to run the project

# Licence
The code is copyrighted and no specific licence for its use or distribution is granted. That said, users are welcome to inspect the code, clone the repository and copy code snippets if doing so would help them solve problems with their own projects. But don\'t rip it off wholesale.
